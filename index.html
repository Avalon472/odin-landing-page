        <p id = "quote">Through the cracks and shadows, we thrive. 
            The world’s filthy, and we feast on its scraps. 
            We don’t just survive; we claw, gnaw, and rip 
            through the wreckage. The city is our nest, 
            the alleyways our veins. No one sees us coming, 
            no one knows we’re here—until we’re already 
            gnawing at their bones. There’s no honor in 
            clean hands. Only in the dirt, in the rot, 
            in the chaos, do we truly live.</p>
